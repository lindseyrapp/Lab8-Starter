Graceful degradation and service workers are related because they both help web applications to work in non-ideal conditions. With graceful degradation, an app can still work & have basic features even if other advanced ones are not supported. Service workers manage network requests and cache data so an app can still work without an internet connection. They both are used to ensure that apps can be used under various conditions.
